00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000 line:80%
This is racing today. Oh, he's getting into the back of his rival. Lock up.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000 line:80%
Oh, they nearly made contact again.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000 line:80%
This is really aggressive stuff. Give me a replay of that move around the outside.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000 line:60%
Dive bomb move from George Russell on his teammate.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000 line:80%
Hamilton had to give him the space and George Russell will have a smile a mile wide there

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000 line:80%
because he's made the pass at the chicane, but Hamilton will not take that lying down.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000 line:80%
The two Mercedes not at the front of the field like they were last week.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000 line:80%
Over some debris goes George Russell there. Hamilton trying to retake 7th position.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000 line:80%
Russell thought about nibbling back and Hamilton retakes the place.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000 line:80%
George was a little bit kinder to Lewis at the chicane there.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000 line:80%
Having made the move, other drivers might have just forced him to go through the run-off area to stay on.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000 line:80%
And technically, being ahead of the apex, he would have been entitled to do that.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000 line:80%
But he's racing fairly and Lewis took the opportunity very well coming back through.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000 line:60%
Oh, he's going to be bringing the tyres into the temperature window

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000 line:60%
at the same time that Joe tries to retake that position away from H端lkenberg.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000 line:80%
Can H端lkenberg get past? No, and he might get shuffled back.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000 line:80%
And Yuki Tsunoda says, okay, you fight amongst yourselves. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000 line:80%
He goes past one. Can Yuki Tsunoda find the way past another? These three are putting on a show.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000 line:80%
They're in the same order that they were before. Tsunoda feeling brave on the brakes, getting past Joe

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000 line:80%
and he will go on the attack.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000 line:80%
All of that caused by Ocon coming out of the pits, who says, oh, enjoy that battle, I'm off.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000 line:80%
Beautiful race car from the three of them, though, wasn't it?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000 line:80%
H端lkenberg tried to do the move again that he put on Tsunoda as Tsunoda came out of the pits.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000 line:80%
They all got bunched up, and that was just superb stuff from Tsunoda in the end.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000 line:80%
Joe Cordova trying to come back again.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000 line:60%
You're on board with Sergio Perez, very much closer now to Carlos Sainz.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000 line:80%
H端lkenberg's Sainz is to Alonso as well. Perez is really close. He's going to have a dive here towards Veil.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000 line:80%
Down the inside, Sergio Perez has a look to try and get past Carlos. Carlos gives him space

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000 line:80%
and thankfully they don't touch, but he's now got it on the exit, and he's through.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000 line:80%
Nicely done, Checo. And now the Williams of Alex Albon's going to try to capitalize on the Ferrari

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000 line:80%
side-by-side into Stowe.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000 line:80%
Wow, he's done it. Alex Albon gets past Carlos as well.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000 line:80%
Alex has gone up into eighth place. Oh, yes, from Alex Albon, really good commitment at the first corner.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000 line:80%
And that one fire up the inside from Sergio Perez, but Sainz way offline, left him vulnerable.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000 line:80%
The red ball came through, the Williams came through.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000 line:60%
As we move now to Piastri being attacked by Sergio Perez.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000 line:80%
Perez, there's the late defensive move from the Australian driver who hugs the apex.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000 line:80%
He says, go the long way round, nothing between the two of them, but it's better grip,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000 line:80%
better traction than the DRS, and fourth position for Sergio Perez.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000 line:80%
Perez needed that. That was an aggressive move around the outside.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000 line:80%
Piastri not giving it up as he runs out onto the grass. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000 line:80%
So, brilliant piece of driving from both drivers there.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000 line:80%
Late move from Piastri, but fair enough. And then he opens the steering,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000 line:80%
but I love how Piastri comes back at him again in Turn 2.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000 line:80%
Yeah, I thought he was fully sending here as Perez gets the elbow out.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000 line:80%
I think there was contact at Turn 1.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000 line:80%
Yeah, it was so, so close between the two.In the end, Perez making it through.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000 line:60%
As the Alpines now nose-to-tail, Ocon trying to get around Gasly.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000 line:80%
Is he going to take a stab into Turn 1? These two are side-by-side, but not for much longer.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000 line:80%
The two teammates battling it out. And Esteban Ocon deep into Turn 1. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000 line:80%
Gasly sweeps on by. Great racing between these two.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000 line:80%
Nervy moments on the pit wall for Alpine. These two have history

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000 line:80%
this season back in Australia where they collided after a great run.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000 line:80%
Give me a replay of that move around the outside.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000 line:80%
Esteban Ocon going all in in Vegas and taking 5th place.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000 line:80%
It's absolutely brilliant, brilliant racing.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000 line:80%
And I guess not only in the pit wall would they be a bit nervy.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000 line:80%
They've got their celebrity investors, some good wheel-to-wheel action.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000 line:80%
But we were all sort of holding our breath there to know if they could do it without touching.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000 line:60%
This is so close between the two Scala Ferraris who go onto the main straight.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000 line:80%
Charles Leclerc has got enormous momentum here.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000 line:80% 
They're side-by-side at Monza. And Charles Leclerc is moving ahead.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000 line:80%
He's got the inside line. Charles Leclerc takes 3rd place in the Italian Grand Prix.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000 line:80%
But he's locked up to give another opportunity.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000 line:80%
Who cranks on the steering wheel? Looking for the line.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000 line:80%
How did he not make contact with his teammate there? 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000 line:80%
I feel that I've just seen a ghost car. You know, the wheels, they must have been so close to touching.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000 line:80%
Sainz has the inside line. Will he have the position? Lock up. Oh, they nearly made contact again.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000 line:80%
This is really aggressive stuff from the two teammates.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000 line:80%
Great battles, intense battles. Ferrari, well, guaranteeing they get the lion's share of the television coverage.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000 line:80%
With the demise of Charles Leclerc

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000 line:60%
Fernando Alonso's maximum he knew at the start of the day was going to be a place on the podium.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000 line:80%
When his teammate hit him at this corner, he would have thought that it was falling away from him.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000 line:80%
But what sort of traction has he got now? Oh, he's nearly into the back of his rival as they go down the hill.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000 line:80%
And Alonso had such better traction that he nearly crept right into the back of Carlos Sainz.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000 line:80%
I tell you, we've not only learned it's a fast car,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000 line:80%
we've learned it's a strong car because we had his teammate Wacom.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000 line:80%
Is he going to do the same as he did to Hamilton? 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000 line:80%
Is he going to go to the outside, to the inside there? He tried again.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000 line:80%
Oh, and Sainz was wise to it. But the lock-up is going to mean that they're basically parked up

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000 line:80%
as they apply the power now. And Alonso gets a little bit of slipstream, and he's making the move.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000 line:80%
Sainz is nearly driving him off the road. But Fernando Alonso is onto the podium once again in Formula 1.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000 line:80%
What a debut he is having with Aston Martin.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000 line:60%
Fernando Alonso now on the inside of Gasly into 12th.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000 line:80%
What are we seeing out there? Something about Sao Paulo sets these drivers alight.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000 line:80%
What a move. Gasly will want it back immediately.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000 line:80%
This is racing today, it really is. DRS for Alonso and Gasly. They're side-by-side 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000 line:80%
Both had DRS. Super late on the brakes. Fernando Alonso all the while they're chasing down Piastri.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000 line:80%
Gasly just keeps it. But we're going to continue this battle. Oh, look at how much Gasly.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000 line:80%
We're snaking all over the road. And Alonso on the power earlier. Has the momentum.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000 line:80%
Has the chance. But it's going to be the outside line.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000 line:80%
Who's bravest at the turn number four? Who's got the racing line? Nearly contact.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000 line:80%
Fernando Alonso with a great pass. How has none of this ended in tears yet either?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000 line:80%
Wheel to wheel, inches apart. All of these guys still bunched behind Carlos Sainz.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000 line:80%
And the racing today is just superb.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000 line:80%
I love that they're having to get a little bit experimental

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000 line:80%
with where they're making the moves in this DRS train as well.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000 line:60%
Here we go. Is there a chance to respond for Fernando Alonso?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000 line:80%
Forces a defensive move. That's not what Perez needs.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000 line:80%
If he goes off the racing line, he could be vulnerable to four.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000 line:80%
And all the while, Max Verstappen is nearly in the final corners of the last lap.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000 line:80%
Alonso is going to get the run down at turn number four.

00:07:20.000  --> 00:07:23.000 line:80%
This is going to be super aggressive between the two of them.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000 line:80%
Alonso has fought his way back through. What a move, Fernando Alonso. On the last lap.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000 line:80%
And the crowd absolutely loved it. The old master takes back the place. What a battle between these two.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000 line:80%
Absolutely superb. I really didn't see Fernando coming back once Checo had made the move.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000 line:80%
But he managed to stay close.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000 line:80%
Brilliant drive. Beautiful stuff from both. 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000 line:60%
Fernando Alonso to the inside of Sergio Perez. And taking the position away.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000 line:80%
There's still a little bit of traction left for Perez. Three into one corner will not go.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000 line:80%
Round the outside goes Esteban Ocon. Side by side with Fernando Alonso,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000 line:80%
who's wide in this part of the circuit.

00:08:03.000  --> 00:08:06.000 line:80%
And somehow they're in the same order that they left.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000 line:80%
Oh, no, they're not. Because here comes the Alpine. Better traction.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000 line:80%
And that will be the position. Fernando Alonso refuses to give it up. But he'll have to.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000 line:80%
And Ocon moves up to eighth. How was the not contact?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000 line:80%
That was frantic stuff. And what frustration for Fernando Alonso.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000 line:80%
He's nearly got past Perez. And in the end, he's dropped to place.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000 line:80%
Yeah, well, that's the threat when you're going slowly behind the Red Bull.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000 line:80%
They're all bunched up. You lose trying to attack. And suddenly, Ocon's through.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000 line:80%
So even more frustration for Fernando Alonso.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000 line:80%
I mean, he could have made the place on Checo if he released the brakes

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000 line:80%
and didn't stay within track limits. But he did.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000 line:80%
He slowed the car down a lot through the apex.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000 line:80%
And that's what allowed, first of all, Perez to get the undercut back on him.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000 line:80%
And then Ocon to have the chance.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000 line:80%
And it was really smart driving from Ocon and opportunistic.
