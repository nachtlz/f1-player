00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000 line:80%
This is racing today. Oh, he's getting into the back of his rival. Lock up.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000 line:80%
Oh, they nearly made contact again. This is really aggressive stuff. Give me a replay of that move around the outside.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000 line:60%
Dive bomb move from George Russell on his teammate.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000 line:80%
Hamilton had to give him the space and George Russell will have a smile a mile wide there

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because he's made the pass at the chicane, but Hamilton will not take that lying down. The two Mercedes not at the front of the field like they were last week.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Over some debris goes George Russell there. Hamilton trying to retake 7th position. Russell thought about nibbling back and Hamilton retakes the place.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000
George was a little bit kinder to Lewis at the chicane there. Having made the move, other drivers might have just forced him to go through the run-off area to stay on.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000 line:80%
And technically, being ahead of the apex, he would have been entitled to do that.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000 line:80%
But he's racing fairly and Lewis took the opportunity very well coming back through.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000 line:60%
Oh, he's going to be bringing the tyres into the temperature window

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000 line:60%
at the same time that Joe tries to retake that position away from H端lkenberg.

00:01:06.000--> 00:01:10.000 line:80%
Can H端lkenberg get past? No, and he might get shuffled back.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And Yuki Tsunoda says, okay, you fight amongst yourselves. He goes past one. Can Yuki Tsunoda find the way past another? These three are putting on a show.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:30.000
They're in the same order that they were before. Tsunoda feeling brave on the brakes, getting past Joe, and he will go on the attack. All of that caused by Ocon coming out of the pits, who says, oh, enjoy that battle, I'm off.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Beautiful race car from the three of them, though, wasn't it? H端lkenberg tried to do the move again that he put on Tsunoda as Tsunoda came out of the pits.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
They all got bunched up, and that was just superb stuff from Tsunoda in the end. Joe Cordova trying to come back again.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000 line:60%
You're on board with Sergio Perez, very much closer now to Carlos Sainz.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000 line:80%
H端lkenberg's Sainz is to Alonso as well. Perez is really close. He's going to have a dive here towards Veil.

00:01:52.000--> 00:02:02.000
Down the inside, Sergio Perez has a look to try and get past Carlos. Carlos gives him space, and thankfully they don't touch, but he's now got it on the exit, and he's through.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Nicely done, Checo. And now the Williams of Alex Albon's going to try to capitalize on the Ferrari side-by-side into Stowe.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Wow, he's done it. Alex Albon gets past Carlos as well. Alex has gone up into eighth place. Oh, yes, from Alex Albon, really good commitment at the first corner.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And that one fire up the inside from Sergio Perez, but Sainz way offline, left him vulnerable. The red ball came through, the Williams came through.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000 line:60%
As we move now to Piastri being attacked by Sergio Perez.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000 line:80%
Perez, there's the late defensive move from the Australian driver who hugs the apex.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
He says, go the long way round, nothing between the two of them, but it's better grip, better traction than the DRS, and fourth position for Sergio Perez.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Perez needed that. That was an aggressive move around the outside. Piastri not giving it up as he runs out onto the grass. So, brilliant piece of driving from both drivers there.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Late move from Piastri, but fair enough. And then he opens the steering,but I love how Piastri comes back at him again in Turn 2.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Yeah, I thought he was fully sending here as Perez gets the elbow out. I think there was contact at Turn 1. Yeah, it was so, so close between the two.In the end, Perez making it through.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000 line:60%
As the Alpines now nose-to-tail, Ocon trying to get around Gasly.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000 line:80%
Is he going to take a stab into Turn 1? These two are side-by-side, but not for much longer.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The two teammates battling it out. And Esteban Ocon deep into Turn 1. Gasly sweeps on by. Great racing between these two.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Nervy moments on the pit wall for Alpine. These two have history this season back in Australia where they collided after a great run. Give me a replay of that move around the outside.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Esteban Ocon going all in in Vegas and taking 5th place. It's absolutely brilliant, brilliant racing. And I guess not only in the pit wall would they be a bit nervy.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000
They've got their celebrity investors, some good wheel-to-wheel action. But we were all sort of holding our breath there to know if they could do it without touching.

00:04:08.000--> 00:04:12.000 line:60%
This is so close between the two Scala Ferraris who go onto the main straight.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000 line:80%
Charles Leclerc has got enormous momentum here. They're side-by-side at Monza. And Charles Leclerc is moving ahead.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
He's got the inside line. Charles Leclerc takes 3rd place in the Italian Grand Prix. But he's locked up to give another opportunity.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Who cranks on the steering wheel? Looking for the line. How did he not make contact with his teammate there? I feel that I've just seen a ghost car. You know, the wheels, they must have been so close to touching.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000 line:80%
Sainz has the inside line. Will he have the position? Lock up. Oh, they nearly made contact again.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:57.000
This is really aggressive stuff from the two teammates. Great battles, intense battles. Ferrari, well, guaranteeing they get the lion's share of the television coverage.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000 line:80%
With the demise of Charles Leclerc

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000 line:60%
Fernando Alonso's maximum he knew at the start of the day was going to be a place on the podium.

00:05:06.000--> 00:05:16.000
When his teammate hit him at this corner, he would have thought that it was falling away from him. But what sort of traction has he got now? Oh, he's nearly into the back of his rival as they go down the hill.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And Alonso had such better traction that he nearly crept right into the back of Carlos Sainz. I tell you, we've not only learned it's a fast car, we've learned it's a strong car because we had his teammate Wacom.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000 line:80%
Is he going to do the same as he did to Hamilton? Is he going to go to the outside, to the inside there? He tried again.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Oh, and Sainz was wise to it. But the lock-up is going to mean that they're basically parked up as they apply the power now. And Alonso gets a little bit of slipstream, and he's making the move.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Sainz is nearly driving him off the road. But Fernando Alonso is onto the podium once again in Formula 1. What a debut he is having with Aston Martin.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000 line:60%
Fernando Alonso now on the inside of Gasly into 12th.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:11.000
What are we seeing out there? Something about Sao Paulo sets these drivers alight. What a move. Gasly will want it back immediately.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000 line:80%
This is racing today, it really is. DRS for Alonso and Gasly. They're side-by-side 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000 line:80%
Both had DRS. Super late on the brakes. Fernando Alonso all the while they're chasing down Piastri.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000 line:80%
Gasly just keeps it. But we're going to continue this battle. Oh, look at how much Gasly.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000 line:80%
We're snaking all over the road. And Alonso on the power earlier. Has the momentum.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Has the chance. But it's going to be the outside line. Who's bravest at the turn number four? Who's got the racing line? Nearly contact.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Fernando Alonso with a great pass. How has none of this ended in tears yet either? Wheel to wheel, inches apart. All of these guys still bunched behind Carlos Sainz.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And the racing today is just superb. I love that they're having to get a little bit experimental with where they're making the moves in this DRS train as well.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000 line:60%
Here we go. Is there a chance to respond for Fernando Alonso?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000 line:80%
Forces a defensive move. That's not what Perez needs. If he goes off the racing line, he could be vulnerable to four.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And all the while, Max Verstappen is nearly in the final corners of the last lap. Alonso is going to get the run down at turn number four. This is going to be super aggressive between the two of them.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000 line:80%
Alonso has fought his way back through. What a move, Fernando Alonso. On the last lap.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000 line:80%
And the crowd absolutely loved it. The old master takes back the place. What a battle between these two.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Absolutely superb. I really didn't see Fernando coming back once Checo had made the move. But he managed to stay close.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000 line:80%
Brilliant drive. Beautiful stuff from both. 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000 line:60%
Fernando Alonso to the inside of Sergio Perez. And taking the position away.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000 line:80%
There's still a little bit of traction left for Perez. Three into one corner will not go.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Round the outside goes Esteban Ocon. Side by side with Fernando Alonso, who's wide in this part of the circuit. And somehow they're in the same order that they left.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000 line:80%
Oh, no, they're not. Because here comes the Alpine. Better traction.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000 line:80%
And that will be the position. Fernando Alonso refuses to give it up. But he'll have to.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And Ocon moves up to eighth. How was the not contact? That was frantic stuff. And what frustration for Fernando Alonso.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
He's nearly got past Perez. And in the end, he's dropped to place. Yeah, well, that's the threat when you're going slowly behind the Red Bull.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000 line:80%
They're all bunched up. You lose trying to attack. And suddenly, Ocon's through.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So even more frustration for Fernando Alonso. I mean, he could have made the place on Checo if he released the brakes and didn't stay within track limits. But he did.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000
He slowed the car down a lot through the apex. And that's what allowed, first of all, Perez to get the undercut back on him. And then Ocon to have the chance.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000 line:80%
And it was really smart driving from Ocon and opportunistic.
